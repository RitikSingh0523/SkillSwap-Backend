# Gemini CLI Suggestions for SkillSwap Backend

Here is a summary of the improvements suggested for the SkillSwap backend project on July 11, 2025.

## High-Level Architectural Suggestions

1.  **Modular Structure:** To improve scalability and maintainability, I recommend adopting a more modular structure. A common and effective pattern for Express applications is:
    - `src/models/`: For your Mongoose database schemas.
    - `src/controllers/`: To handle the business logic for each route.
    - `src/routes/`: To define your API endpoints.
    - `src/middleware/`: For custom middleware like authentication or error handling.

2.  **Testing Strategy:** The current `test` script in `package.json` is a placeholder. Robust applications require a solid testing strategy.
    - **Framework:** Integrate a testing framework like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) with [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/).
    - **Coverage:** Write unit tests for your controllers and services, and integration tests for your API endpoints to ensure they behave as expected.

3.  **Centralized Error Handling:** Your current error handling is limited to the database connection. Implementing a centralized error-handling middleware will make your application more robust. This middleware can catch all errors thrown in your route handlers and send a consistent, formatted error response to the client.

## Code and Dependency Recommendations

1.  **Linter and Formatter:** To maintain a consistent code style across your project, especially if you work with other developers, consider adding:
    - **ESLint:** A linter to find and fix problems in your JavaScript code.
    - **Prettier:** An opinionated code formatter to ensure consistent styling.

2.  **Security Best Practices:**
    - **Helmet:** Use the `helmet` middleware to secure your Express app by setting various HTTP headers.
    - **Input Validation:** Use a library like `joi` or `express-validator` to validate and sanitize incoming request bodies to prevent common vulnerabilities.

3.  **Environment Variables:** You are correctly using `dotenv` to manage environment variables. Ensure that your `.env` file is included in your `.gitignore` file to prevent secrets from being committed to version control.
